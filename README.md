This is a game where the computer picks a random number and you try to guess it in the least attemps possible! Once you guess it, it tells you how many attemps it took you and it will tell you your high score of all the rounds.

To play this game, you can run the Python code on an online Python complier, on a IDE, etc. Or, you can just go to the GitHub pages site for it and play the game there: https://raspberrypi400.github.io/guess-the-number/
